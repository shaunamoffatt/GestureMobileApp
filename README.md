#  $1 Unistroke Recognizer using TouchScript Gesture Unity Android App

## Demonstration- Island God

Use Gestures to move around an Island as a floating hand. Pick up the islanders and cause havoc with four different spells;

## Purpose of the application

The purpose of the application was to be able to allow a mobile user to move around a 3D game space on an android phone, 
in a manner that appeared smooth and intuitively simple.

The demo is inspired by the 2001 game [Black and White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_%26_White_(video_game))   whos gameplay involves: 

>The player interacts with the environment via an animated, on-screen hand, that is used to throw people and objects, tap houses to wake their occupants, cast miracles, and perform other actions

The goal was also to incorporate some kind of Gesture recognition similar to the spell casting in the Black and White game.

## Hardware used in creating the application

An android with touchscreen capabilities

switch between normal 3D movement and allowing the user to start trying to get their gestured spells recognized.
